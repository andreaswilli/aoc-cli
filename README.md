# Advent of Code CLI

A CLI to make solving [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) puzzles more
convenient.

## Features

- ðŸ‘Ÿ **Run multiple days** with a single command - even if they are implemented in
  **different languages**.
- ðŸ‘€ **Watch** the filesystem and re-run whenever changes are detected.
- âœ… **Verify results** against the content of a file so you immediately know if
  a refactoring broke something.

## Installation

Clone this repo and run `cd cmd/aoc && go install` from its root. This will
make the `aoc` command available in your path.

> [!NOTE]
> Go needs to be installed on your system for this to work.

## Project Structure

Your project should be structured something like this:

```text
advent-of-code/
â”œâ”€ 2024/
â”‚  â”œâ”€ 01/
â”‚  â”‚  â”œâ”€ expected.txt
â”‚  â”‚  â”œâ”€ solution.js
â”‚  â”œâ”€ 02/
â”‚  â”‚  â”œâ”€ expected.txt
â”‚  â”‚  â”œâ”€ solution.py
â”‚  â”œâ”€ ...
â”œâ”€ aoc-cli.json
```

Year and day folders can be named differently, it just needs to match the
commands you run (see [Usage](#usage)).

The names of the files containing the source code need to be configured (see
[Config File](#config-file)).

The file `expected.txt` can be omitted if the output should not be checked.
Otherwise it should contain the expected output written to stdout by your code.

## Config File

The config file is in JSON format and defines engines to run your code. Find
some examples [here](cmd/aoc/aoc-cli.json).

```js
{
  "engines": [
    {
      "name": "node",              // engine name, for display only
      "cmd": "node {{entryFile}}", // command to run, use file name placeholder
      "entryFile": "solution.js"   // file name of the source file
    },
    {
      //...
    }
  ]
}
```

## Usage

There are two main commands, `run` and `watch`.

### Run

#### All Days of Year

### Watch
